# Spatial Suppression & Grid Density Budgeting Walkthrough

## Summary of Changes

To satisfy the problem statement requirement of **maintaining uniform distribution of match points across images** without clustering exclusively on salient crater rims or high-contrast terrain features, we implemented a two-stage spatial dispersion pipeline:

1. **Pre-match Spatial Suppression (ANMS / SSC)**:
   - Created [`ML_model/spatial_suppression.py`](../ML_model/spatial_suppression.py).
   - Implemented **Suppression via Square Covering (SSC)** based on Bailo et al. (PRL 2018), utilizing an $O(N \log(\max(W, H)))$ binary search on grid square covers to guarantee homogeneous spatial distribution of keypoints across both images prior to correlation matching.
   - Also implemented standard Brown et al. (MOPS 2005) **Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression (ANMS)** with $c_{\text{robust}} = 0.9$.
   - Integrated salient keypoint detection combining Shi-Tomasi corners and Phase Congruency local structural extrema.

2. **Post-match Grid Density Budgeting ($10 \times 10$ Tiered Round-Robin)**:
   - Replaced flat independent per-cell limits with **tiered round-robin density budgeting** (`apply_grid_density_budgeting`) on a $10 \times 10$ spatial grid.
   - In Round 1, every occupied cell contributes its top-1 highest confidence match, guaranteeing that under-represented cells receive immediate and equal representation in RANSAC before texture-dense cells consume extra slots.
   - Integrated into [`ML_model/matcher_cfog.py`](../ML_model/matcher_cfog.py).

3. **Multi-Region Benchmark Verification & Committed Evidence Diff**:
   - Re-ran [`scripts/benchmark_registration.py`](../scripts/benchmark_registration.py) across all 8 real datasets.
   - Verified the exact diff between the parent commit and the updated registration outputs.
   - Updated [`README.md`](../README.md) with the empirical Before vs. After comparison table and Section 7 Delivery Matrix.

### Key Observations
1. **Active Redundancy Pruning**:
   - Raw candidate match counts decreased by ~45–55% across all regions (e.g. 77 → 41 in `region_001`, 97 → 45 in `triplet_01`). This reflects the intended function of spatial suppression: redundant, co-located candidate clusters on single crater rims are eliminated in favor of a homogeneous spatial spread.
2. **$4\times$ to $6\times$ Spatial Coverage Expansion**:
   - Surviving geometric inliers expand from occupying only 6.0%–7.0% of the $10 \times 10$ image grid up to **31.25%–43.75%**, establishing broad physical anchoring across the full scene.
3. **Sub-Pixel Precision & Error Reduction**:
   - `region_003` achieved a 44% error reduction down to true sub-pixel fit RMSE (**0.9941 px**); `triplet_01` improved from 2.20 px down to 1.55 px (-29.5%); and `region_006` improved from 1.65 px to 1.30 px (-21.2%).
4. **Honest Reporting on `triplet_new_2022`**:
   - Features an extreme $162.25^\circ$ sun-azimuth disparity (diametric illumination reversal). The surviving inliers clustered in a localized band along the bottom edge, correctly triggering Quality Gate 3 (*Pathological projective distortion*). Per the project's zero-synthetic-fallback principle, failure is reported cleanly without fabricating identity transforms.
   - **Update 2026-09-11**: the Gate-3 refusal was measured under the biased refiner. With the validated paraboloid the same pair yields a well-conditioned H (det 4.6, cond 11k, scale-ratio 2.5, projectivity 0.0035): **50 raw / 6 inliers @1.21px, LOW**. Deletion considered and rejected as cherry-picking; both outcomes on record with mechanism. The frozen Before→After table above documents the spatial-suppression change specifically.
